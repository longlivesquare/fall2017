    <article><p>The rules to Gomoku are simple. The object of the game is to be the first to put 5 of your pieces in contiguous line. 
        Each player will take turns puting pieces on an empty intersection. The game ends either when someone gets 5 pieces together in a line or there
        are no more empty intersections.</p></article>
